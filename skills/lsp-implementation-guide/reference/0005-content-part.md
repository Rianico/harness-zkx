### Content Part


**Source:** https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#content-part


Contains the actual content of the message. The content part of a message uses [JSON-RPC](http://www.jsonrpc.org/) to describe requests, responses and notifications. The content part is encoded using the charset provided in the Content-Type field. It defaults to `utf-8`, which is the only encoding supported right now. If a server or client receives a header with a different encoding than `utf-8` it should respond with an error.


(Prior versions of the protocol used the string constant `utf8` which is not a correct encoding constant according to [specification](http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets/character-sets.xhtml).) For backwards compatibility it is highly recommended that a client and a server treat the string `utf8` as `utf-8`.
